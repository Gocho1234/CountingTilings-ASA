# Project 1 ASA

The goal of this project was to tile, or cover with tiles, a given area defined on a rectangle delimited by a stairway. The area to be tiled is defined on a unit grid, with n rows and m columns. The tiles to be used are always squares with multiple unit side dimensions, i.e.: 1 × 1, 2 × 2, etc. Given that you can use an arbitrary number of square tiles of various dimensions, there are several possible configurations of the tiles that allow you to completely cover the area in question.
